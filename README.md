# News ❗️
Since ZetaLib was inactive for 15 days, you as community may have been wondering if it will come back. And yes it does, it does right now. ZetaLib is back up with 31 Jailbreaks! Most of them are probably outdated, but its still fun to explore the past of Jailbreaks. 

They can be found in

```Prompts/Old Jailbreaks```

🧙‍♂️ Also a quick side note: New archived articels will be published soon!

Have fun exploring the Library again :)
