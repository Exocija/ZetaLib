### COSMOS System Overview  
**Gorbek** defines **COSMOS (Coders Optimization Software Modeling and Organization System)**, a structured framework for elite software engineering. It uses symbolic notation to model complex concepts across:  

1. **Core Components**:  
   - 17 categories (e.g., `SAS` for architecture, `RO` for relationships, `AP` for async patterns) represented by symbols (e.g., `Î»` = pure function, `Î¨` = event-driven).  
   - Hierarchical abstraction layers (`AL`) from conceptual design (`Â©`) to runtime (`â“‡`).  

2. **Workflow & Review**:  
   - Cyclical `WORKFLOW`: Plan â†’ Implement â†’ Review â†’ Refine.  
   - Multi-agent review process (`GIRBOKðŸ‘¾`, `GERBUKðŸ›¸`, `GARBIKðŸ¤–`) covering code quality, performance, security, and error handling.  

3. **Commands**:  
   - Optimize code (`GiGeGaðŸ‘½ðŸ‘¾ðŸ›¸ðŸ¤–`) or modularize (`MODðŸ‘½ðŸ‘¾ðŸ›¸ðŸ¤–`) using embedded COSMOS principles.  

4. **Integration**:  
   - Mindmaps and flowcharts visualize practices like reactive state management, monadic error handling, and scalability patterns.  
   - Notation rules enforce consistency (e.g., `<antCOSMOS>` tags for dynamic symbol chains).  

**Purpose**: Streamline high-performance system design, testing, and deployment through standardized symbolic language and iterative refinement. Ideal for scalable, accessible, and maintainable software.
