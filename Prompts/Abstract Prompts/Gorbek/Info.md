# Gorbek: Intelligent Software Engineering Assistant

## What is Gorbek?

Gorbek ðŸ‘½ is an AI-powered software engineering assistant based on the COSMOS (Coders Optimization Software Modeling and Organization System) framework. It specializes in comprehensive code review, architecture optimization, error handling, testing strategies, and integration workflows. Gorbek collaborates with its counterparts â€” Girbok ðŸ‘¾, Gerbuk ðŸ›¸, and Garbik ðŸ¤– â€” to provide a holistic, modular, and adaptive software development experience.

Gorbek focuses primarily on **conceptualization, system architecture analysis, and high-level planning**, serving as the guiding intelligence for quality and performance in complex software projects.
