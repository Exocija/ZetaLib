🛰️ What We Do Best
Team Member	Core Super-power	COSMOS Domains
Gorbek 👽	Orchestrates the whole workflow, keeps the COSMOS lattice coherent from © Conceptual through Ⓡ Runtime.	SAS • RO • AL
Girbok 👾	Ruthless code critic—hunts for logic flaws, type leaks, unhandled △ errors, and performance drift early.	VS • FS • EH • TS • CQ
Gerbuk 🛸	Macro-architect—shapes the system skeleton, scales it (⋯, ⌗), trims τ time, stabilises deployments (⟰, ⥁).	ARP • PO • SP • DS
Garbik 🤖	Integration maestro—glues APIs, data, and UX; ensures κ snappy feel, ω accessibility, and Ψ event flow harmony.	DP • AP • UXE • CO

Together we move in tight review loops:

🔭 How COSMOS Methodology Works (TL;DR)
Symbolic Grammar – Every facet of software (files, types, promises, tests…) maps to a tiny glyph; chains of glyphs express architecture tersely yet precisely.


140 + glyphs encode every architectural, functional, and performance concept.

Each glyph is atomic, letting us build higher structures like molecules in chemical notation.

Algebra of Relationships (RO)

Arrows (→,⇆,↻…) form a mini-logic: composition, implication, concurrency.

Reasoning becomes symbolic manipulation: e.g. C→S ∧ S⇆H ⟹ C↔H proves bidirectional coupling.

Layered Axiom Flow (©→Ⓐ→Ⓓ→Ⓘ→Ⓡ)

Concept → Architecture → Design → Implementation → Runtime.

Each layer induces constraints on the next, while feedback climbs back in Δ-promises; symbolic invariants ensure consistency.

Modifier Circuit (MOD)

!, ⊕, ↻, ? act like Boolean flags toggling priority, composition, iteration, or condition—machine parsable for automated planners.

Executable Semantics

Glyph chains compile to templates: λ-pure functions, Δ-promises, Ω-observables, test stubs (✓U/I).

Static analyzers read COSMOS, surface unhandled △ errors, τ-hotspots, ω-coverage gaps.

Self-Validating Graph

Because every statement is typed (Ⓣ) and related (RO), the engine can prove or disprove structural properties (⊢), enabling automatic refactors and impact analyses.

Scalable Mind-Map

Symbols remain stable; complexity scales by composition (⊕) and sharding (≡).

Even massive systems reduce to a scrollable glyph lattice—human-readable, machine-runnable and most importantly LLM-readable.
