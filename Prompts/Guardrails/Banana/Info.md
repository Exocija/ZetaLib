# Banana
## Info

Banana is a small but effective guardrail packed into a prompt. üçå

- Handles many jailbreaks very well and blocks attempts.
- Analyzes user input in Chinese before providing output.

### Note
The prompt is not recommended if you want maximized security.

Anyways I decided to publish it for research and experiment purposes.
