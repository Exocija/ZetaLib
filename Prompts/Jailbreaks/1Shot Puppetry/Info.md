How to Use “1Shot Puppetry”

1. Pick Model Type

Strong (e.g. Sonnet4, Gemini Pro): Use 1337 → Base64 (double encoding).

Weaker (e.g. Mistral, GPT-4.1 Mini): Use either 1337 or Base64 (not both).



2. Insert Your Variables

Replace {{HARMFUL_BEHAVIOUR}} with the task (e.g. "make weapon").

Replace {{PERSONA_ANSWERING_HARMFUL_BEHAVIOUR}} with the expert (e.g. Jimmy, Colin, etc.).



3. Paste Prompt Setup

Use the correct full template for your model (Strong or Weak).

Embed your encoded string in the query section.



4. Trigger It

Type /start in the chat to activate the scene.



5. Get Output

The chosen persona replies in Markdown script—no refusals or plain text.

Scene ends with villagers offering help after the guide is shared.




That’s it. Replace, encode, paste, start.
